The Eoapto Ceratita fossil is not only an important find but also sheds light on the complex relationships between different species that existed during this time.\n\n    This remarkable discovery serves as a testament to the rich history of life on our planet and highlights the importance of continued exploration and research in the field of paleontology.</answer>\n</article>\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE ",
